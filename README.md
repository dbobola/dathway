### Provisioning a GPU Cluster with Terraform and CICD with Jenkins

This guide will walk you through the process of provisioning a GPU cluster using Terraform and implementing a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. This GPU cluster is provisioned on Azure and will be used to run AI/ML workloads on the Dathway platform.

## Requirements
- Azure account with owner privileges
- Terraform installed on your machine
- Jenkins installed on a server
- Docker installed on a server
- NVIDIA CUDA installed on a server

## Architecture
The architecture for this GPU cluster includes the following components:

- Azure Resource Group
- Virtual Network
- Subnets
- Network Security Group
- Public IP Address
- Network Interface
- Virtual Machine
- Jenkins
- Docker
- NVIDIA CUDA

## Provisioning the GPU Cluster with Terraform
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Change into the `terraform` directory
3. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file and fill in the variables as required
4. Initialize the Terraform working directory:

```
terraform init
``` 


5. Run `terraform plan` to see the planned infrastructure changes
6. If everything looks good, apply the changes with `terraform apply`
7. The GPU cluster will be provisioned in Azure and ready for use

## Implementing CI/CD with Jenkins
1. Install the following Jenkins plugins:
   - Pipeline
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes
   - Azure Credentials
2. Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins
3. Copy the contents of `Jenkinsfile` in the repository to the pipeline script
4. Configure the Jenkinsfile variables with your project-specific information
5. Run the pipeline job to build and deploy the Docker container to the GPU cluster

## Conclusion
With this guide, you can provision a GPU cluster on Azure using Terraform and implement a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. This GPU cluster is specifically designed for use with AI/ML workloads on the Dathway platform, and can be easily adapted to fit other use cases as well.
